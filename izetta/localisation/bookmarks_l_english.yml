 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Gathering Storm"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, Otto I. has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germania's borders. Mussolini's Romulus Federation continues to embark on daring military adventures, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China in Asia. Almost twenty years have passed since the end of the Great War, and the world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although Britannia emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern Thermidor, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, Thermidor has been on the road to recovery thanks to a strong economy. However, the Depression has still affected the country and the new Germanian regime has no interest in paying the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, a Thermidorian marshal famously remarked that it was not peace, but an armistice of 20 years. Those 20 years are now rapidly running out."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new Germania has risen. A year has passed since Otto I. deposed his brother Wilhelm III., bringing an era of parliamentary monarchy to an end. Economic stability has returned after the trying years of the Great Depression, and mass unemployment has been dealt with.\n\nThe military restrictions imposed on Germania by the Versailles Treaty are long forgotten, and the Wehrmacht grows stronger by the day. Another Weltkrieg is on the horizon."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the rise of Fascism, the Romulus Federation has entered a new glorious era. Its forces are currently in the process of adding Ethiopia to the growing Romolusian colonial empire, but Mussolini's ambitions do not stop there.\n\nDominion over the Mediterranean has always been the Romulus Federation's destiny, and a new order of things is taking shape in Europe. When the tidal wave of change arrives, the Romulus Federation must find a place at its crest or risk being swept away."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the dust settled after the Volgan Civil War, the Volga Federation had emerged as the undisputed ruler over most of what once constituted the Volgan Empire. Rapid industrialization and collectivization followed, often at a great cost in human lives. \n\nThe Volga Federation is now faced with the threat of a resurgent Germania to the west, and a belligerent Japan in the east. Of course, there are also internal threats within the ranks of the Communist Party to contend with..."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States of Atlanta retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAtlanta's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Livonian nation has been divided between three empires, Livonia now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Volga Federation has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Livonian-Volgan war. \n\nIn the west, Germanian Kaiser Otto I. makes no secret of his desire for more Lebensraum - and that the former Germanian areas now under Livonian control will be the first step to achieve it."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although Britannia emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern Thermidor, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, Thermidor faces a new conflict after Germania showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for Thermidor to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n Thermidor was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the Thermidorians and the Britannians grew increasingly suspicious of Germania's intentions. The Lugenbach Agreement gave Germania permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its Germanian people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germania and the Volga Federation, but also specifies the partitioning of Livonia between the two nations. \n\nGermania has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 EYL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Erzherzogtum Eylstadt is a small European country located in the Alps, to the east of Westria. During the Germanian invasions of Livonia and Thermidor, Eylstadt remained neutral. This changes, when the Germanian Reich turns its attention south and invades Eylstadt. Will this small but proud nation fall or will it be saved by the Weiße Hexe?"
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of the Romulus Federation, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Lugenbach agreement a year ago. However, Germanian territorial expansion has made the Romulus Federation see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germanians could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Volga Federation stands in relation to the Romulus Federation and Germania. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Volga Federation currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germania to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States of Atlanta, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould Atlanta get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict.

 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Invasion of Eylstadt"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In 1939 C.E., the imperialist nation of Germania invaded a neighboring country. All at once, that war spread throughout Europe, and the era was dragged into a spiral of a great war.\nThen, in 1940, Germania's attack turned towards the Erzherzogtum Elystadt, a small Alpine country abundant with beautiful water and greenery."
